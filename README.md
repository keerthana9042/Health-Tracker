# FOOD  NUTRITION TRACKING

# BODY MASS INDEX
BODY MASS INDEX (BMI):Body Mass Index (BMI) monitoring is a method used to estimate an individual's body weight in relation to their height. It's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)).Healthcare professionals use BMI for initial assessments, and many individuals use it for self-monitoring and tracking changes in their body weight and overall health over time. While BMI is a helpful tool, it should be interpreted cautiously, and additional assessments may be necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding.
